# FAQ for Technical Details

This article contains a list of frequently asked questions for the Shopify connector.

## What is Shopify? 

Shopify is a subscription-based software that allows anyone to set up an online store and sell their products. The Shopify platform offers online retailers a suite of services including payments, marketing, shipping, and customer engagement tools. 

## What is the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Shopify connector? 

The Shopify connector gives customers the ability to connect their Shopify store (or stores) with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to maximize business productivity. By using the Shopify connector, they can manage and view insights from their business and their Shopify online store as one unit. 

## Why did Microsoft and Shopify form this partnership? 

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_long.md)] is teaming up with Shopify to help our customers create a better shopping experience. While Shopify provides merchants with an easy-to-use commerce solution, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] offers comprehensive business management across finance, sales, service, and operations teams within a single application. Seamless connection between the two systems will synchronize orders, stock, and customer information to ensure merchants can fulfill orders faster and better serve customers.

## Availability

This feature is available only for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online, starting with version 20.1. It isn't available for on-premises deployments. The app with the connector is pre-installed for new customers. Existing customers can download and install the app from AppSource. Customers need to have both a Business Central license and a Shopify license to use the connector. For more information about supported countries, languages, and editions of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], see [Shopify Connector on the AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2196238).

## Support

Shopify Connector is covered by current support model. For more information, see [Technical Support](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration//manage-technical-support). 

To get help with Shopify start with [General Shopify Help Center](https://help.shopify.com/) or [24/7 Support for your store as a Shopify merchant](https://help.shopify.com/questions#/).

## Extensibility

Currently, this app is non-extensible. We expect to make it extensible at a time in the future that isn't currently determined.

## Contribution

This extension is open for contribution by the community. You can find the [source code](https://github.com/microsoft/ALAppExtensions/tree/main/Apps/W1/Shopify) in the Microsoft AL application add-ons repository.
