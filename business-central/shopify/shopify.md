## Configure Shopify Account

## Install the Scaptify app

In order to allow Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central to securely connect to Shopify, you need to install the Scaptify app. It will create application credentials in Shopify that Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central will use to connect to Shopify.

Follow the steps below to create the credentials:

-   Log in to the Shopify Admin page of your store  
    e.g.:

-   In the menu on the left, click "Apps"
