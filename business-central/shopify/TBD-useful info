====================



## Setup Shops




-   Select 'Allow Background Syncs' if you want to run the synchronization in background.    //TBD: to be moved to "other, part trouleshouting. 






Customer:

-   Define which fields in Business Central needs to be filled with which fields in Shopify.



Remark: The customer created is the bill-to customer.




The last step is to do some settings for order processing.

-   Enter the 'Shipping cost Account', the Sold Gift Card account and the Tip account.

-   Select if you want to show your Shopify Order No. in the lines of your Sales document in Dynamics 365 Business Central

-   Tax Area Source

**There are some <u>restrictions</u> for the Tax/VAT setup.**

Taxes:
When you use multiple VAT/tax percentages, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] should be leading. Furthermore, the item should already exist in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. A new item is created based on the defined item template and uses the VAT/tax percentage defined in this template, not the one set in the Shopify Shop.

##  Gift Cards

In the Shopify Shop, you can buy gift cards. When you synchronize orders, gift cards are also synchronized to 'Gift Cards'.

## Payouts

If your store has Shopify Payments enabled, then you receive payments through Shopify Payouts when a customer pays using Shopify Payments and specific accelerated checkouts.

The payouts can also be synchronized to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

Go to your Shopify Shop and execute 'Sync Payouts'.
