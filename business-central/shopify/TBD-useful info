**There are some <u>restrictions</u> for the Tax/VAT setup.**

Taxes:
When you use multiple VAT/tax percentages, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] should be leading. Furthermore, the item should already exist in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. A new item is created based on the defined item template and uses the VAT/tax percentage defined in this template, not the one set in the Shopify Shop.
