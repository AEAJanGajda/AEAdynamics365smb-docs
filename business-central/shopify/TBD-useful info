====================



## Setup Shops





Customer:

-   Define which fields in Business Central needs to be filled with which fields in Shopify.


Remark: The customer created is the bill-to customer.




**There are some <u>restrictions</u> for the Tax/VAT setup.**

Taxes:
When you use multiple VAT/tax percentages, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] should be leading. Furthermore, the item should already exist in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. A new item is created based on the defined item template and uses the VAT/tax percentage defined in this template, not the one set in the Shopify Shop.


- **Tax area source** - defines priority of tax codes. Applies to contries that are using sales tax. For more information see [Tax on Shopify](TBD).
    Define your tax area source and the sequence that needs to be followed.

    -   No taxes
    -   Ship-to &gt; Sell-to &gt; Bill-to
    -   Ship-to &gt; Bill-to &gt; Sell-to
    -   Sell-to &gt; Ship-to &gt; Bill-to
    -   Sell-to &gt; Bill-to &gt; Ship-to
    -   Bill-to &gt; Sell-to &gt; Ship-to
    -   Bill-to &gt; Ship-to &gt; Sell-to


##  Gift Cards

- **Sold Gift Card Account**, for more information, see [Gift Card](TBD)

In the Shopify Shop, you can buy gift cards. When you synchronize orders, gift cards are also synchronized to 'Gift Cards'.

## Payouts

If your store has Shopify Payments enabled, then you receive payments through Shopify Payouts when a customer pays using Shopify Payments and specific accelerated checkouts.

The payouts can also be synchronized to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

Go to your Shopify Shop and execute 'Sync Payouts'.

The transactions that took place in Shopify can be viewed in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] via 'Transactions'. They are synchronized together with the orders.
