# Get Business Central Desktop App

If you have a Windows (PC) or macOS computer, you can install a Business Central app on your desktop. 
> [!NOTE]
> If you're using Business Central 2021 release wave 1 or earlier, get the app from [Windows Store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=734848).

## Why use the app?

The Business Central app resembles the web client, but it provides a few benefits like:

- The app is readily available from the **Start** menu, you can easily pin it to the task bar, or have it launch by default when you start your computer.
- The app opens in its own window, independent of any browser windows, which makes it easier to find when running a large number of apps or browser tabs.
- In general, the app also is a faster and smoother to render on screen, with no performance differences, compared to running Business Central in the browser.
- When working across multiple Business Central windows or multitasking, each window is displayed separately.
- When working with several named environments, the name is added to the windows title making it easier for you to see which window is associated with an environment.

## Get the app

1. Open the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] web client in your browser.

2. To the right of the browser's address bar, select ![Icon for installing an app in Edge.](media/ui-edge-install-app-icon.png) **App available. Install Business Central** or ![Icon for installing an app in Chrome.](media/ui-chrome-install-app-icon.png) **Install Business Central**, then **Install**.
