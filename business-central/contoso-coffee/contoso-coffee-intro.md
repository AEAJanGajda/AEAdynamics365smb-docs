# Introduction to Contoso Coffee Demo Data

CONTOSO is a fictitious company that produces consumer and commercial coffee makers. The **Contoso Coffee** app for Business Central adds demo data that you can use to learn how to use the manufacturing capabilities in Business Central. The app provides four products that are optimized for different scenarios:

- **SP-SCM1009 Airpot**

  This product has BOM with subassembly, Routing. Can be used to demonstrate standard production flow. Uses Standard costing. Has alternative routings that can be used to demonstrate various scenarios involving subcontractors.

- **SP-SCM1011 Airpot Duo**

  This product requires item tracking and uses the *Special* costing method. Has component that also requires item tracking.

- **SP-SCM1004 Autodrip**

  This product has BOM with subassembly, Routing. Excellent to demonstrate various flushing methods both for components and operations.

- **SP-SCM1008 AutoDripLite**

  This product has 3 variants and 3 bills of material (BOMs) that can be assigned to stockkeeping units. Uses phantom BOM concept.

The manufacturing activities for all scenarios use the *NORTH* location.

Before running any of the scenarios for Contoso Coffee, you should post any item journal lines with opening balances.
