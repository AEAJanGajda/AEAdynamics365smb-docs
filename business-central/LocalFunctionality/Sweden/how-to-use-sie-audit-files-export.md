# Import and export data in the standard import export format for Sweden
You can import and export general ledger data according to the standard import export (SIE) format. By specifying SIE dimensions and file types, you can specify the level of detail covered by import or export transactions. For more information, see [Standard Import Export Group](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=164870&clcid=0x41d).  

> [!NOTE]
> Automatic account code is part of the Swedish localization. However, starting in version 22.1, Swedish localization will be based on the W1 base app and the SIE functionality will be moved to the extension installed by default. This functionality is based on the Audit Files Export app with preinstalled SIE format. To learn more about this change, see [Audit Files Export](finance-how-to-export-audit-files.md).
