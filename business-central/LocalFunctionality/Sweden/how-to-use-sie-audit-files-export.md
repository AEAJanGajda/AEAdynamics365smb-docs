# Import and export data in the standard import export (SIE) format

You can import and export general ledger data according to the standard import export (SIE) format. By specifying SIE dimensions and file types, you can define the level of detail that's covered by import or export transactions. For more information, see [Standard Import Export Group](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=164870&clcid=0x41d).

> [!NOTE]
> Automatic account code is part of the Swedish localization. However, as of version 22.1, the Swedish localization will be based on the W1 base app, and the SIE functionality will be moved to the extension that's installed by default. This functionality is based on the Audit Files Export app that has the pre-installed SIE format. To learn more about this change, see [Audit Files Export](../../finance-how-to-export-audit-files.md).
