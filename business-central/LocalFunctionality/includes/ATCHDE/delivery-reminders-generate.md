In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)], when a purchase isn't delivered as expected, you can create delivery reminders. You can generate delivery reminders for all overdue deliveries, or you can create a single delivery reminder manually.  

> [!NOTE]  
> To create delivery reminders, you must set up the delivery reminder terms, levels, and texts.  

## To generate delivery reminders for all overdue deliveries  

1. Choose the ![The lightbulb icon that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delivery Reminder**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose the **New** action.  
3. On the **Delivery Reminder** page, choose the **Create Delivery Reminder** action.  
4. Select the appropriate filters.  
5. Choose the **OK** button.  

If the filters you set match overdue deliveries, delivery reminders are created. You can now issue and print delivery reminders.
