# Calculate Proportional VAT
You can use proportional VAT to calculate VAT when there is both deductible and non-deductible VAT. Because it is difficult to know where and how an item is used, you will have to contact the Norwegian tax authorities to determine whether a specified percentage of the VAT is deductible based on historical data.  

### To calculate proportional VAT  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Posting Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **VAT Posting Setup** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|
