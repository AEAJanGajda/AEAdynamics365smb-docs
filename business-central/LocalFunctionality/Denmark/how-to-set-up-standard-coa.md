# Standard Chart of Accounts in Denmark 

The new Danish bookkeeping act requires the use of a standard chart of accounts. Because of this requirement, the Danish tax authority is providing a standard chart of accounts that can be used. Use the chart of accounts when you prepare annual accounts and calculate regular tax and VAT payments. You can use any chart of accounts included on the **Chart of Accounts** page, but for required reporting, you must map all GL account with the standard chart of accounts required by the law using the **G/L Mapping page**.    

## Set up Standard Chart of Accounts  

GL accounts require a specific standard chart of accounts for use in Denmark. Before you start, make sure you install the **Audit Files Extension** Microsoft app. After you configure your GL accounts, your exported files (SAF-T and Regnskab Basis) are based on the configured mappings. To configure a standard chart of accounts, provide the GL account as explained in this article [Audit file export](../../finance-how-to-export-audit-files.md).
