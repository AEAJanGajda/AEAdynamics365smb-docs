# Introduction in Standard Chart of Accounts in Denmark 

New Danish bookkeeping act requires using a standard chart of accounts. The Danish tax authority provides a standard chart of accounts that can be used. The chart of accounts is used when preparing annual accounts and calculating regular tax and VAT payments. Users can use any chart of account as they want in the **Chart of Accounts** page, but for required reporting they must map all GL account with the standard chart of accounts required by the law using the **G/L Mapping page**.    

## Set up Standard Chart of Accounts  

G/L accounts require a specific standard chart of accounts for usage in Denmark. Before you start you need to be sure that you have installed **Audit Files Extension** Microsoft app. Therefore, after you configure your G/L accounts, your exported files (SAF-T and Regnskab Basis) will be based on the configired mappings. To configure standard chart of accounts, follow steps to provide the G/L account explained in this article [Audit file export](../../finance-how-to-export-audit-files.md).
