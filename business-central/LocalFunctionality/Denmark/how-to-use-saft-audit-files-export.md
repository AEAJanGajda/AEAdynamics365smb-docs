# Export the SAF-T audit file format in Denmark

You can export all mandatory required data according to the SAF-T format in Denmark. SAF-T (Standard Audit File for Tax) is an international standard for the electronic exchange of reliable accounting data from organizations to a national tax authority or external auditors. Danish tax authorities are using the OECD standard SAF-T as the standard file format for the reporting. However, some specific Danish fields exist in this file export.  

## Audit Files Export 

Exporting the SAF-T file format in Danish localization is based on the Microsoft app, **Audit Files Extension**.
