# Export the SAF-T audit file format in Denmark

You can export all mandatory required data according to the Standard Audit File for Tax (SAF-T) format in Denmark. SAF-T is an international standard for the electronic exchange of reliable accounting data from organizations to a national tax authority or external auditors. Danish tax authorities use Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) standard SAF-T as the standard file format for reporting. However, some Denmark-specific fields exist in this file export.  

## Exporting audit files

Export of the SAF-T audit file format in the Danish localization is based on the **Audit Files Extension** Microsoft app. For more information, see [Audit file export](../../finance-how-to-export-audit-files.md)  

For more information, see [Danish Local Functionality](denmark-local-functionality.md).
