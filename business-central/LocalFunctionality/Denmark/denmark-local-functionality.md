    > [!Note]  
    > A new Danish bookkeeping act enforcing the use of digital bookkeeping systems went into place in July 2022. However, although the law is approved, the details on how it will be implemented by businesses and ERP systems is being released by the Danish Business Authority in phases. Microsoft will be following guidelines to ensure our **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** and **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance** solutions are certified within the parameters as deadlines are set. All updates to Dynamics 365 will be made available through our standard product release cycles. More information will be made available in this article.
