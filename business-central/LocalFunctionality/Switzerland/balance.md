# Balance in the Swiss Version
Specifies a temporary general ledger balance. When you choose the **Balance** action on the **G/L Accounts** page, the **G/L Acc. Provisional Balance** page opens. It shows the balance of the final posted ledger entries and the balance of the postings entered in the current general journal.
