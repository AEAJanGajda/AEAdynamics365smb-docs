The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires one or more versions of the 1099 tax form for payments to vendors. Copies of these forms must be sent to vendors annually on or before the last day of January. On your purchase documents, you can specify that the document is 1099 liable, and you can specify the 1099 code for the vendor.

# Setup
Before starting work, you need to set up **1099 Form Boxes** and **Vendors** as 1099 liable. The most common 1099 Codes are already set up and they are defined on the **1099 Form Box** page, where you can also add new 1099 Codes. Before you prepare your reporting for the new year, you must first upgrade your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to handle the new requirements.

## To update the 1099 Form Boxes:
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **1099 Form Box**, and then choose the related link.
2. Run the **Update Form Boxes** action on the **1099 Form Boxes** page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Running the action **Update Form Boxes** makes reporting for the previous year impossible, since some boxes change their meaning. Make sure that you have done all your reporting for the previous year before you update the form boxes to prepare your system for reporting for the new year.

## To set up the Vendor as 1099 liable:
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant vendor's card.
3. Choose the **Payments** FastTab and select the **IRS 1099 Code** field, where you can choose one of applicable IRS 1099 codes.

# Documents and entries
## To process the document as 1099 liable:
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoice**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new entry and in the **Vendor Name** field on the **Purchase Invoice** header, enter the vendor with selected IRS 1099 code.
3. Choose the **Shipping and Payment** FastTab and you will find that the **IRS 1099 Code** field has been automatically populated based on the Vendor configuration. If you want to use another code, you can override it with another one or delete it to have transaction without IRS 1099 code.
4. Enter all information into the required fields for purchase invoice and post the document.
5. Once the document is posted, within the **Vendor Ledger Entries** you will find that the **IRS 1099 Code** and **IRS 1099 Amount** fields are automatically populated.

> [!NOTE]
> Instead of a ***Purchase Invoice** you can also use **Purchase Order** as a document, but in this case the **IRS 1099 Code** field will be on the **Invoice Details** FastTab.

## To correct posted entries:
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant vendor's card.
3. On the **Vendor Card** page, choose **Ledge Entries** action to open the **Vendor Ledger Entries** page where you can review list of all transactions for your vendor.
4. Locate the entry you want to correct.
5. If you want to change IRS code, find the **IRS 1099 Code** field, and change the code for the right one.
