# Using the same External Document Numbers accross fiscal years
In general [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] does not allow for posting documents with the same value in **External Document No.**, not even accross fiscal years, due to legislation. In Spain however, this is accepted, and now [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] includes an option to allow this behaviour. 

## To allow posting of the same **External Document No.** accross fiscal years

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **General** FastTab enable the field **Same Ext. Doc. No. in Diff. FY**
