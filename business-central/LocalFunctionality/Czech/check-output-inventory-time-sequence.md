# Check of Output in Inventory – Time Sequence in the Czech Version

The standard functionality of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] has been extended by checking the time sequence of warehouse operations. After activating the check, it is ensured that it is not possible to delivery items with a posting date preceding the posting date of its receipt.
