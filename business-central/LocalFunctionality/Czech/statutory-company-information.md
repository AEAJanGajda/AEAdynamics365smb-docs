# Statutory Company Information in the Czech Version

Many documents are circulating within and outside company structures. The minimum necessary requirements of such documents are set by local legislations. It is possible to divide such requirements roughly into three groups:

- Company officials' names must be present on some internal and external documents.
- Document footers â€“ The majority of external documents must contain basic company information in document footers, usually in the company's partner language.
- Registration numbers must be visible in internal and external documents.

This feature allows users to define company officials and designate them as General Manager, Accounting, and Finance Managers for usage in internal and external documents.

Users can define document footers in different languages. Such footers can be used in different reports and documents.

Additional company registration numbers and other registration information can be stored on the **Company Information** page and used in documents.
