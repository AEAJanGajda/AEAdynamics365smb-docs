# Sales invoices in France 

## Set up new customer  

To set up new customer properly, on the **Customer** card user must populate the **SIREN No.** field in the **Invoicing** FastTab, as this number is mandatory for printing sales invoices.  

If new customer has been created from existing **Contact** card, value in the **SIREN No.** field will be copied from the same field in the **Contact** card.

## Working with the sales documents 

When users create new sales document, they can choose if the want to have printed that *VAT paid on debts*. To do so, user must enable the **VAT Paid on Debts** field in the **Invoice Details** FastTab. 

> [!NOTE]
> When print sales documents [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] will automatically show in the comment if sales invoice includes only goods, only services, or both of them. It depends on the **Type** field option on the **Item** card (Inventory or Service) or using Resources or G/L Account.  

> [!NOTE]
> If user use alternative address in the sales invoice, [!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] will automatically show this address in the comment of printed report.
