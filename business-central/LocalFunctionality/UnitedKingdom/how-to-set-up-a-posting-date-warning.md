# Set Up a Posting Date Warning
A warning message will be displayed when you post or batch post sales and purchase documents with a posting date not same as the work date. You must set up for this on the **Sales Receivables Setup** and **Purchases Payables Setup** pages.  

## To set up a posting date warning for sales and purchases  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup** or **Purchases & Payables Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Sales Receivables Setup** page or the **Purchases Payables Setup** page, in the **General** FastTab, select the **Posting Date Check on Posting** check box.  
3.  Choose the **OK** button.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  A warning message displays when you post or batch post documents with a posting date not same as the work date. If you select **Replace Posting Date** check box while batch posting, you will be warned about the replacing posting date not being the same as the work date.
