# Create Financial Journals in the Belgian Version
Financial journals are used to register bank account transactions. A financial journal lets you enter a starting balance and an ending balance and automatically calculate the difference so that you can verify that all of the transactions have been registered.  

## To create a financial journal  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Journal Templates**, and then choose the related link.
