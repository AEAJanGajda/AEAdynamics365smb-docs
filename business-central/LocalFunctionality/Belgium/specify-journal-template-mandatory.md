# Make Journal Templates Mandatory in the Belgian Version

You can use journals to post purchase and sales documents and make other general ledger entries. Journal templates can then help you structure different types of entries. In the Belgian version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you must specify if journal templates are required in the current company.  

## To make journal templates required in a company

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **General** FastTab, select the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field. This field specifies if users must specify a journal template and batch when they post general ledger transactions.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If the **Journal Template Name Mandatory** field is not selected, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] will not use template names in the posted documents and entries.
