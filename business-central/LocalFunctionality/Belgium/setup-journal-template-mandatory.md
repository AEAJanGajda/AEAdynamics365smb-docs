If you want to use Journal Templates during the posting of Purchase and Sales documents and also in the General Ledger Entries, you need to configure **Journal Templ. Name Mandatory** properly.

# To set up Journal Templ. Name Mandatory
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Ledger Setup**, and then choose the related link. 
2. In the **General** FastTab, switch **Journal Templ. Name Mandatory** as TRUE. It will specify if a journal template and batch names are required when posting general ledger transactions.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you leave **Journal Templ. Name Mandatory** field as FALSE, Business Central will not use template name in posted documents and entries.
