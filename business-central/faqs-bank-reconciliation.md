# FAQ for generative AI integration

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of generative AI integration feature in Business Central.

## What is generative AI?

[Describe the system in plain English. What type of system or feature is this? What does it do? At a high level, what does the system or feature take as input? What kind of outputs does the system or feature produce?]

Generative AI integration enables AL developers to use Azure OpenAI Service's powerful AI models to deliver a rich ecosystem of AI-powered extensions for Business Central. With only a few lines of AL code, developers can enhance their solutions with generative AI that feels seamlessly integrated into the Business Central user experience and can be delivered as a natural part of their add-ons or customizations.

## What are capabilities of the generative AI?

[Building on the previous question, provide semi-technical, high-level information on how the system or feature offers functionality for various uses.]

## What is the intended use of the generative AI?

[Explain intended use(s), as identified in your Impact Assessment.]

## How was generative AI evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

[Provide evidence of system or feature accuracy and performance, and, when applicable, a description of the extent to which these results are generalizable across use cases that were not part of the evaluation.]

## What are the limitations of generative AI integration? How can users minimize the impact of the generative AI integration limitations when using the system?

[See Impact Assessment. Describe the known limitations of the system or feature including uses for which the system was not designed or evaluated. Discuss steps that the user can take to minimize errors and the impact of trade-offs for the user.]

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the feature?

[Describe the operational factors and ranges within which the system is expected to perform reliably and safely. List the choices that end users can make (e.g., customization, settings, etc.), with a description of how those choices may impact system behavior in the real world.]
