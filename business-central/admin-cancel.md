# Unsubscribe or Remove [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

If you want to stop using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can close your account or get the license removed from your account. The steps to take are different if you're currently using the free trial, or if you have a subscription.  

## Closing your free trial of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

If you want to cancel your trial, your administrator must remove the trial subscription from your company's account in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/).  

> [!TIP]
> If you're canceling your Microsoft 365 account, then your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] access will expire automatically. All data will be deleted after 45 days of non-use.

You might have signed up for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] using a non-Microsoft 365 business account. In that case, you don't have a Microsoft 365 administrator. Let the trial expire, and the data will then be deleted after 45 days of non-use.  

We recommend that you export any data before you close your account. You can read about how to export data to Excel in the [Exporting Data to Other Finance Systems](about-export-data.md#exporting-data-to-other-finance-systems). If you would rather export all data to an Azure storage container, your Microsoft 365 administrator can do that in the admin center. For more information, see [Exporting Databases in the Admin Center](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-database-export).  

## Removing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from your Microsoft 365 experience

Your company continues to subscribe to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] but you as a user no longer want access. In this case, your administrator can remove the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] license from your Microsoft 365 user account in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/). Your coworkers will still have access to your company's data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

If your company wants to unsubscribe from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the Dynamics 365 reselling partner can remove the paid subscription from the company's account. For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-administration) in the developer and administration content.  

User accounts and licenses are managed in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/). Only administrators can remove [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] licenses from user accounts or remove the subscription from your company's account. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 Business subscriptions and billing documentation](/microsoft-365/commerce/).  

## Removing [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from your app launcher

If you want to hide [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] from your app launcher, you can unpin it. No data is lost, and the step doesn't cancel your subscription.
