# Business Central Accounting and Bookkeeping Guide
Accounting is one of the critical functions in any ERP solution, as well as in almost any business. It represents the process of recording and cataloging of company’s financial transactions, along with retrieving, measuring, summarizing, and presenting the results using different reports, often required by local legislation, but with the primary goal of allowing the company’s management to understand the financials of its business and measuring the results of a company’s economic activities.

As a part of accounting, bookkeeping is regularly recording all financial transactions in companies. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is an ERP with integrated tools for easier bookkeeping inside the system, where many actions can be done automatically.

This accounting and bookkeeping guide contains outlines for bookkeeping processes (rules, procedures, and other guidelines…) in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. It is intended to help accountants and bookkeepers in their daily work with this ERP system. You can find the complete guide here, but inside the products, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a context-based incorporated assistant containing links to information related to the opened page and instructions on how to work with the specific process. To get this help, the user must click the [**Help**](product-help-and-support.md) icon in the upper right corner, and the Help pane will appear. From this Help pane, users can easily find links in **About this task or page** and **Related resources from Microsoft Learn**.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the articles that cover them.
