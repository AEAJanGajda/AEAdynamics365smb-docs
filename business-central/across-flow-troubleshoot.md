# Troubleshoot Your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Automated Workflows

When you connect [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Power Automate to create automated workflows, you might run into error messages. This article provides suggested solutions to frequently recurring problems.

## "Entity set not found‚Äù error

### Problem

When you create a new Power Automate flow using a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] approval trigger, such as *When a purchase document approval is requested*, you might get an error message similar to the following:

`Entity set not found: \<name\>`

The placeholder, `\<name\>`, is the service name of the missing web service, such as *workflowWebhookSubscriptions* or *workflowPurchaseDocumentLines*.

### Possible cause

Using Power Automate to integrate with your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] approvals requires that certain page and codeunit objects are published as web services. By default, most of the required objects are published as web services for you. But in some cases, your environment may have been customized so that these objects are no longer published.

### Fix

Go to the **Web Services** page and make sure that the following objects are published as web services. There should be an entry in the list for each object, with the **Published** check box selected.  

|Object Type|Object ID|Object Name|Service Name|
|-----------|---------|-----------|------------|
|Codeunit|	1544	|WorkflowWebhookSubscription|WorkflowActionResponse|
|Page|	6408|	workflowCustomers|	workflowCustomers|
|Page	|6406	|workflowGenJournalBatches|	workflowGenJournalBatches|
|Page	|6407	|workflowGenJournalLines|workflowGenJournalLines|
|Page	|6409	|workflowItems|	workflowItems|
|Page	|6405	|Purchase Document Line Entity|workflowPurchaseDocumentLines|
|Page|	6404	|workflowPurchaseDocuments|	workflowPurchaseDocuments|
|Page|	6403	|Sales Document Line Entity	|workflowSalesDocumentLines|
|Page|	6402|	workflowSalesDocuments|	workflowSalesDocuments|
|Page|	6410	|workflowVendors|	workflowVendors|
|Page|	831	|workflowWebhookSubscriptions|	workflowWebhookSubscriptions|

> [!NOTE]
> The **Service Name** value must be exactly as shown in the table. Don't change or translate the service name.
