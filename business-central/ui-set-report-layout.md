# Setting the Report Layout

A report layout determines the look of a report. It controls which data fields of a report dataset appear on the report and how they are arranged, text style, images, and more. A report can have more than one layout, which you can then switch among as needed. When there are multiple companies in the application, the layouts are set on a per-company basis. So the same report in one company can have a different layout in another company.

There are two ways to set which layout a report uses. One way is from the **Report Layout Selection** page, the other way is from the **Report Layouts** page. Each page has advantages over the other: 

- The **Report Layout Selection** page displays a lists of all reports. The advantage of this page is it indicates what current layout is. It also let's you set layouts used for different companies, without having to switch the company you're working with.

- The **Report Layouts** page displays all available layouts for each report in the current company. By listing all layouts, it's easy to find a specific layout by sorting or filtering the list. Once you find the layout you want, you can set it for a report with a single click. 

## Set the layout from Report Layout Selection page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.
  
   The page lists all the reports that are available for the company that's specified in the **Company** field at the top of the page. The **Layout Description** field specifies the layout that the report currently uses.
2. Set the **Company** field at the top to the company that includes the report.
3. Find and select the report in the list, then do one of the following steps:

    - If the layout you want to switch to is a different type than the current layout, select the **Layout Type** field, then choose the type of the layout you want to set on the report. 
    - If the layout you want to switch to is the same layout type as the current layout, choose the **Select Layout** action at the top.

4. In the **Report Layouts** page, select the layout, then select **OK**.

### Set the layout from the Report Layouts page

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Report Layouts**, and then choose the related link.
  
   The **Report Layouts** page lists all the report layouts for each report.
2. Find the layout in the list, select it, the choose **Set Default** action at the top of the page.
