# Use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in an Automated Workflow

You can use your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] data as part of a workflow in Microsoft Power Automate.  

Starting in May 2022, an admin of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online can [switch on a feature](admin-feature-management.md) to make it possible to run a Power Automate flow from most pages. For more information, see [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) in the administration content.  

Once the admin has connected [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Power Automate, you'll see any flows that your organization has added when you choose the **Automate** action in the relevant pages. You run the flows without leaving [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!NOTE]  
> You must have a valid account with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and with Power Automate.  

> [!TIP]
> In addition to Power Automate, you can use another workflow capability within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Note that although they are two separate workflow systems, any approval workflow template that you create with Power Automate is added to the list of workflows within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Workflows](across-workflow.md).  

## Automated workflows

Many pages have an **Automate** action. This action gives you access to workflows that your admin, another user, or Microsoft has defined as relevant for that page. These automated workflows open in a pane inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online so that you remain within context of the business process you were in the middle of. In some pages, the **Automate** action hides under the **More Options** menu, but find it, choose the **Power Automate** menu item, and then choose the relevant link to trigger the workflow. The connection to Power Automate is already set up for you.  

Most flows will require you to fill in a field or two before you choose the **Run flow** action.  

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see an **Automate** action, then your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] probably hasn't yet been set up to use Power Automate. For more information, ask your admin.

## Add automated flows and manual instant flows

You can create flows at the [powerautomate.microsoft.com](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com) website. However, if your admin has switched on the capability to run Power Automate flows from inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can start the process of building a flow from the **Automate** action on the relevant pages. In some pages, the **Automate** action hides under the **More Options** menu, but find it, choose the **Power Automate** menu item, and then choose the **Create a flow** action. Power Automate then opens in a new browser tab, and you're signed in automatically.

With Power Automate, you can create business flows directly in-house and rely on citizen developersâ€‹. For more information, see [Set Up Automated Workflows](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/powerplatform/automate-workflows) in the administration content.  

## Manage workflows

You can get an overview of all workflows that you have access to by choosing the **Manage workflows** action in the **Power Automate** menu. The list opens in a new browser tab, and you signed in to Power Automate automatically. There, you can see when each flow ran most recently.  

## Troubleshooting

When you connect [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] with Power Automate to create automated workflows, you might run into error messages. For more information, see [Troubleshoot your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Automated Workflows](across-flow-troubleshoot.md).  

### Flow doesn't run on all records created or changed

#### Problem

If an event creates or changes many records, the flow doesn't run on some or all records.

#### Possible cause

There's a limit on how many records that a flow can process. If more than 100 records are created or changed within the 30 seconds, the flow won't be triggered.

> [!NOTE]
> For developers, the flow triggering is done via webhook notifications, and this limitation is due to the way the Business Central connector handles `collection` notifications. For more information, see [Working with Webhooks in Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/dynamics-subscriptions) in the Developer and IT Pro help.
