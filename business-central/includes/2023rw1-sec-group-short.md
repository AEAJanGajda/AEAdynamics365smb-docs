> [!NOTE]
> Security groups are new to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] in 2023 release wave 1. They're similar to the user groups that this article mentions. Like user groups, administrators assign the permissions to the security group that its members need to do their jobs.
>
> Security groups will replace user groups in a future release. You can continue using user groups to manage permissions until then. To learn more about security groups, go to [Control Access to Business Central Using Security Groups](../ui-security-groups.md). To start using security groups now, your administrator can turn on **Feature: Convert user group permissions** on the **Feature Management** page.
