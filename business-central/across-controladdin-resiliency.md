# Control Add-In Resiliency in Business Central

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] release wave 1, control add-ins that perform slowly are automatically detected and a dialog similar to the following is displayed.

![Busy control add-in.](media/controladdin-resiliency.png "Busy control add-in.")

A slow control add-in typically impacts the performance of the page that you are working on and may reduce your productivity. If you see a dialog as shown above, you can close it, but it might come back and if the problem persists, you should contact the administrator of the system.
