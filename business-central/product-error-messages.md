# Warnings and Error Messages in Dynamics 365 Business Central

During your work day, you might see notifications in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that something went wrong, or that it was not possible to post something, for example. In many cases, the notification makes it easy to resolve the matter, or to roll back any changes that you made. In other cases, you might not have have the information that you need to get unblocked. This article provides tips on how to make progress.  

## In-product user assistance

The default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] includes descriptions for most fields, columns, and actions that can be accessed when you choose the name. In combination with teaching tips for important pages, descriptive captions, and instructional text, these tooltips, or callouts, are our current implementation of *embedded user assistance*, which is an important principle in today's world of software design.  

If you have a question about a field or another element of the user interface, choose the name, and a short description will appear. Choose the *Ask Copilot* link if that isn't enough. You can also use the in-product Help pane to find answers to your questions.  

For more information, see [Dynamics 365 Business Central User Assistance Model](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/user-assistance) in the administration content for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Help and Support page

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the Help menu item (the question mark in the top right corner) gives you access to the **Help and Support** page, where you can find links to resources that can help you find answers to your questions. For more information, see [Resources for Help and Support](product-help-and-support.md).  

## Help others

If you are an administrator or superuser, you can help others by looking up error messages in the **Error Message Register** page or in the administration center. In many cases, the warning or error message is about setup or lack of permission and similar issues that the superuser or administrator can easily help with. In other cases, you might have to inspect pages to identify the cause. For more information, see [Finding technical information](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/manage-technical-support#finding-technical-information) in the administration content for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

## Share error detials for faster assistance

Leverage the expertise of colleagues or subject matter experts to overcome obstacles and minimize downtime. When you're blocked by an error, you can easily share the error details when you get assistance. 

The details include the error message, error code, and other information that's helpful when troubleshooting an error. By sharing the error details, you can effectively communicate the specific issue you're facing, which helps your colleagues help you.  

You can copy details by choosing the **Share icon** in in-line validation dialogs, or the **Share details** menu in error dialogs.  

In addition to copying error details, you can also choose to share details through Microsoft Teams by choosing **Share details to Teams** to do the following:

* Copy the error details.
* Open the **Share to Teams** window, where you can paste the error details you copied and specify who you want to ask for help. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds a link to the page where you experienced the error to make troubleshooting easier.

You can also choose to share details by email by choosing **Share details via email** to do the following:

* Copy the error details.
* Open your default email editor, where you can paste the error details you copied and specify who you want to ask for help. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] adds a link to the page where you experienced.
