This article explains how to use chat with Copilot to get answers about your company data and assistance with tasks and a subject matter.â€‹

## About chat with Copilot

Chat with Copilot is an AI-powered tool that answers questions and finds business data related to Business Central. By expressing what you're looking for in natural language, you can use the chat with Copilot feature to: 

- Find business data for the company you're working with in Business Central. Use chat to look up (and open) data about entities/records related to business processes, such as customers, vendors, sales orders, and items, and more. For example, ask Copilot: "Show me the latest sales order for Adatum." or "How many sales invoices have been posted this year."
- Explain a concept or get guidance on how to accomplish a task. For example, ask "Help me understand dimensions" or "How to I post a sales order".

  The answers that Copilot provides are based solely on the official Dynamics 365 Business Central documentation, which is available on Microsoft Learn at [Dynamics 365 Business Central documentation](/dynamics365/business-central/).

Chat with Copilot circumvents the need to navigate the user interface or product help, which can save time and increase productivity.

   The **Copilot** pane displays on the right as illustrated in the following figure:

    ![Shows the icon for chat with Copilot pane with callouts](media/chat-with-copilot-pane.svg)

1. In the **Ask a question** box at the bottom ![Shows the icon for chat with Copilot pane with callouts](media/callout-number-2.svg), enter your question, and then select the arrowhead or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to get an answer.

   The text you enter can be in the form of a question, statement, or command.

   > [!TIP]
   > Copilot includes a couple features that can help your write questions:
   > - To get started on formulating a question, select one of the prompts&mdash;**Find**, **Explain**, or **Guide**&mdash;available the top of the pane ![Shows callout number 3](media/callout-number-3.svg) or from the **View Prompts** button above **Ask a question** box ![Shows callout number 3](media/callout-number-4.svg). Prompts are predefined short phrases that start a question. Apart from saving you time, they're designed to target responses to specific categories. They also help you undestand how you can phrase questions to get the responses.
   > - Select the sample questions above the View prompts button ![Shows callout number 5](media/callout-number-5.svg) to automatically ask a predefined question to get insight into how the questions and answers work.  

1. Review the answers displayed in the Copilot pane ![Shows callout number 6](media/callout-number-6.svg).

   Depending on your question, the answer can contain text, links to records or pages in Business Central, and links to Business Central help articles on Microsoft Learn.

1. Ask another question to refine the answer.
