# Sharing Data with Business Central

Collaboration among people inside and outside an organization is integral part of most businesses. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] offers several features for sharing business data with others&mdash;inside and outside your organization, with or without a Business Central license. Data can be in the form of a link or a file.

With all these features, access to data is protected by the license and permissions system of Business Central. 

## Copy link

> Applies to: Online, On-premises

From any page, you can copy the page's URL, then paste and send it to others in media like emails, Teams chats, or text messages. The easiest way to copy a link is by selecting **Share** > **Copy Link** from the top of the page. Another way is to copy the URL directly from the browser address box.

> [!TIP]
> After you copy a link, before you send it, you can modify the URL to manipulate what is displayed when the page is opened. For more information, see [Web Client URL](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-web-client-urls).

## Share to Teams

> Applies to: Online

Directly from most collection pages, like the Items page, and details pages, like the Items card, you can send a link to the page to specific recipients in a Teams conversation. For example, you can share a link to a filtered view of your records. Recipients can then select the link to open the page in Business Central

## Open and Share in OneDrive

> Applies to: Online, On-premises

Business Central makes it easy to store, manage, and share files with other people through OneDrive for Business. On most pages where files are available, such as the Report Inbox or files that are attached to records, you'll find the **Open in OneDrive** and **Share** actions. Both actions save a copy of a file to OneDrive. Once in OneDrive, you can use its sharing and contribution features on the file. The difference in the actions is that **Open in OneDrive** opens the file in OneDrive. **Sharesaves a copy of a file to a Business Central folder in your OneDrive and opens the file. Copy the file to your OneDrive and share it with other people.


Share to Teams
Tips about sharing views, filters, current record, what cannot be shared
Share as a table (Copy+Paste, or via Excel) -> Link to article (could no go below it in TOC)
Sharing files (via OneDrive) -> Link to article (could now go below it in TOC)
Hint that you can construct your own Url - link to technical article on that
Could start with a table that compares the above options with on prem vs SaaS
NOTE: This could serve as a good place to talk about how data can be shared with non-BC users aka "Project Satya" (note: own release train)
