# Setting Up Purchasing

Before you can manage purchase processes, you must configure the rules and values that define the company's purchase policies.

You must define the general setup, such as which purchase documents are required and how their values are posted. This general setup is typically performed once during the initial implementation.

A separate series of tasks related to registering new vendors is to record any special price or discount agreements that you have with each vendor.

Finance-related purchase setup, such as payment methods and currencies, are covered in the Finance Setup section. For more information, see [Setting Up Finance](finance-setup-finance.md). Similarly, inventory-related purchase setup, like units of measure and item tracking codes can be found in the [Inventory Setup section](inventory-setup-inventory.md).
